						<h2 class="section-heading">SPHINX</h2>
						<p>
							In ancient times, the Sphinx was a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion. It was known for its enigmatic and mysterious nature, and for guarding the entrance to the city of Thebes. Legend has it that the Sphinx would pose a riddle to anyone who wanted to pass, and those who could not solve the riddle would be devoured. The most famous riddle of the Sphinx was: "What creature walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?"
						</p>
					
						<p>
							The answer, of course, is a human: we crawl on all fours as a baby, walk on two legs as an adult, and use a cane as an elderly person. It was only when the Greek hero Oedipus correctly answered the riddle that the Sphinx was vanquished, throwing itself off a cliff in despair.The story of the Sphinx has captivated the imagination of people for centuries, and its enigmatic and complex nature has made it a symbol of mystery, wisdom, and challenge. This is why the Sphinx has been a popular inspiration for artists, writers, and thinkers throughout history.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							But the Sphinx also has a connection to the world of cryptography, which makes it an appropriate symbol for your post-quantum blockchain project. In ancient Egypt, cryptography was used to encode messages and protect sensitive information, much like how modern cryptography is used to secure digital transactions and data. The pharaohs and their advisors used cryptography to communicate securely over long distances, without fear of interception or tampering. They relied on codes and ciphers to encode their messages, which could only be deciphered by those who possessed the key.
						</p>

						<p>
							This ancient practice of cryptography highlights the enduring importance of securing information and protecting sensitive data. It also demonstrates the power of cryptography to transform the world, by enabling secure communication and enabling trust in digital transactions. This is why our post-quantum blockchain project is called the SPHINX, and it's also inspired by the <span><a class="docs-theme-link" href="https://sphincs.org/" target="_blank">SPHINCS+</a></span> post-quantum digital signature algorithm. Just like the Sphinx guarded the entrance to the city of Thebes, your blockchain project guards against the threat of quantum computing and provides a secure and decentralized platform for digital transaction
						</p>
					
						<p>
							The SPHINX blockchain represents the perfect marriage of ancient wisdom and modern technology. It combines the time-tested practice of cryptography with the cutting-edge innovation of post-quantum algorithms, paving the way for a new era of secure and decentralized finance.
						</p>

						<p>
							Join us on this journey to the future of blockchain technology, where the mysteries of the Sphinx are finally unlocked.

						    <h4>The Blockchain</h4>
								<p>
									Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. It is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a set of transactions, and each block is linked to the previous block using cryptography. This makes it very difficult to tamper with the data in the blockchain, as any changes would be immediately visible to the entire network.
								</p>
	
								<p>
									The concept of blockchain was first proposed in 1991 by <span><a class="docs-theme-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta</a></span>. However, it wasn't until 2008 that blockchain technology was first used in practice, with the launch of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that uses blockchain technology to track transactions.
								<p>
	
								<p>
									Blockchain works by creating a chain of blocks, each of which contains a set of transactions. Each block is linked to the previous block using cryptography, which makes it very difficult to tamper with the data in the blockchain. When a new transaction is submitted to the network, it is added to the next block in the chain. Once a block is added to the chain, it is very difficult to remove or modify, as this would require changing all of the subsequent blocks in the chain.
								<p>
	
								<p>
									Blockchain is secure because it is decentralized and tamper-proof. The data in the blockchain is not stored on any one computer, but rather on a network of computers. This makes it very difficult for anyone to hack or manipulate the data. Additionally, the data in the blockchain is encrypted, which makes it even more difficult to tamper with.
								<p>
	
								<p>
									Blockchain is transparent because all transactions are recorded on the blockchain and can be viewed by anyone. This makes it very difficult for anyone to hide fraudulent or illegal activity. Additionally, the blockchain is auditable, which means that anyone can verify the authenticity of the data.
								<p>
								<br>
								<h4>Blockchain economy</h4>
								<p>
									A peer-to-peer transaction coin is a digital or virtual currency that is designed to be transferred directly between two parties without the need for a third party, such as a bank or financial institution. Peer-to-peer transaction coins use blockchain technology to record transactions and to ensure their security and authenticity.
								</p>
	
								<p>
									The first peer-to-peer transaction coin was <span><a class="docs-theme-link" href="https://bitcoin.org/" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a></span>, which was created in 2009. Bitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group of people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was designed to be a digital currency that would be free from government control and inflation.
								</p>
	
								<p>
									Since the launch of Bitcoin, a number of other peer-to-peer transaction coins have been created, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. These coins have different features and benefits, and they are all competing for market share.
								</p>
	
								<p>
									Tokenomics is the study of the economics of a blockchain-based token. Tokenomics encompasses a wide range of factors, including the supply and demand for the token, the utility of the token, and the governance of the token.
								</p>
	
								<p>
									The supply and demand for a token is determined by a number of factors, including the number of tokens in circulation, the number of tokens that are being created, and the number of tokens that are being burned. The utility of a token is determined by the use cases for the token. For example, a token that can be used to pay for goods and services will have more utility than a token that can only be used to vote on governance proposals. The governance of a token is determined by the rules that govern how the token is created, distributed, and used.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
							<h4>1. Hash Functions in Blockchain Technology</h4>

							<p>
								one of the fundamental components of blockchain technology is the use of hash functions. Hash functions are cryptographic algorithms used to generate a unique fingerprint, or hash, of a piece of data. This fingerprint serves multiple purposes, such as verifying data authenticity and detecting any changes made to the data.
							</p>

							<p>
								In blockchain, hash functions play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and security of the stored information. The most commonly used hash function in blockchain is SHA-256, renowned for its high level of security and resistance to cryptographic attacks. Other hash functions like RIPEMD-160 and BLAKE2b are also employed in specific blockchain applications.
							</p>

							<p>
								By employing hash functions, blockchain technology ensures that the data stored on the blockchain is protected against unauthorized modifications. Additionally, the use of hash functions allows for efficient verification of data integrity without revealing the underlying information, contributing to the transparency and auditability of blockchain systems.
							</p>

						<h4 class="mt-5">2. Key encryption in blockchain</h4>
								<p>
									Another important cryptographic technique utilized in blockchain is asymmetric key encryption. Asymmetric key encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, involves the use of key pairs: a public key for encryption and a corresponding private key for decryption.
								</p>

								<p>
									In the context of blockchain, asymmetric key encryption enables secure communication between parties without the need for a shared secret key. One widely used asymmetric key algorithm in blockchain is ECDHE-ECDSA, which utilizes elliptic curve cryptography and offers a high level of security. Additional algorithms like RSA and DHE-RSA may also be employed for specific blockchain applications.
								</p>

								<p>
									The adoption of asymmetric key encryption in blockchain technology enhances the confidentiality and privacy of sensitive information. It allows participants to securely exchange data and messages without compromising the secrecy of their private keys. Asymmetric key encryption is a key component in ensuring the secure transmission and storage of data within blockchain systems.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									The most widely used asymetric key in blockchain technology is DLP based on koblitz curve (SECP256K1), like bitcoin or ethereum used today. The secp256k1 curve was developed by Dr. Daniel J. Bernstein and Dr. Tanja Lange in the late 1990s. It is named after the <a class="docs-theme-link" href="https://www.secg.org/
									" target="_blank">"SECG"</a>(Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group), which is an organization that publishes standards for cryptographic algorithms.

								<h5>Elliptic Curve Equation:</h5>
									<p>
										The secp256k1 curve is defined by the equation:   <code>y^2 = x^3 + 7 (mod p)</code>,
										where   <code>p</code> is a large prime number that defines the finite field, and   <code>x</code> and   <code>y</code> are coordinates on the curve.
									</p>

								<h5>Prime Field Arithmetic:</h5>
									<p>
										All calculations in elliptic curve cryptography are performed in a finite field.
										In the case of secp256k1, the finite field is defined by a prime number   <code>p</code>, which is   <code>2^256 - 2^32 - 977</code>.
									</p>

								<h5>Point Addition:</h5>
									<p>
										The addition of two points on the secp256k1 curve is defined by geometrically adding the coordinates of the points
										and taking into account the curve's equation. The result of adding two points   <code>P</code> and   <code>Q</code> is a third point   <code>R = P + Q</code>.
									</p>

								<h5>Point Doubling:</h5>
									<p>
										Point doubling is a special case of point addition, where the point being added is the same as the point being doubled.
										Geometrically, this involves finding the tangent line to the curve at the point and finding the intersection of this line with the curve.
										The result is a new point that is the double of the original point.
									</p>

								<h5>Scalar Multiplication:</h5>
									<p>
										Scalar multiplication is the main operation used in elliptic curve cryptography.
										It involves multiplying a point on the curve by a scalar (a private key) to obtain another point on the curve.
										Mathematically, scalar multiplication can be performed using repeated point addition and doubling.
									</p>

								<h5>Base Point:</h5>
									<p>
										In secp256k1, a specific point called the base point   <code>(G)</code> is defined on the curve.
										It has known coordinates   <code>(x, y)</code> and is used as the starting point for scalar multiplication.
										The base point G generates all possible points on the curve when multiplied by different private keys.
									</p>

								<h5>Discrete Logarithm Problem:</h5>
									<p>
										The security of elliptic curve cryptography relies on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem.
										Given a point   <code>R</code> on the curve, it is computationally difficult to determine the scalar   <code>K</code> such that   <code>R = k * G</code>, where   <code>G</code> is the base point.
										This property ensures the security of the private key.
									</p>

						<h4 class="mt-5">3. Signature for authentication</h4>
								<p>
									Digital signatures are cryptographic techniques employed in blockchain technology to provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation of data. Digital signatures use asymmetric key encryption to generate a unique signature that can be verified using the corresponding public key.
								</p>

								<p>
									By utilizing digital signatures, blockchain systems can ensure the authenticity and integrity of transactions and other data stored on the blockchain. Common digital signature algorithms used in blockchain include DSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA, which provide robust security for verifying the origin and integrity of messages and transactions.
								</p>

								<p>
									Digital signatures play a crucial role in blockchain applications such as authorizing payments in banking systems and validating transactions within a blockchain network. They provide a secure and tamper-proof method to prove the authenticity and authorship of data, ensuring trust and accountability within the blockchain ecosystem.
								</p>

								<p>
									The most widely used digital signature in blockchain technology is ECDSA based on ECDLP <a class="docs-theme-link" href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/4/final" target="_blank">"NIST published the Digital Signature Standard (DSS)</a>, like bitcoin or ethereum used today. ECDSA was proposed by a team of researchers, including Scott Vanstone, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was introduced as an alternative to traditional digital signature algorithms, such as the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), that were based on modular arithmetic. ECDSA leverages the mathematical properties of elliptic curves to provide efficient and secure digital signatures.
								</p>

								<p>
									The development and standardization of ECDSA involved various organizations and institutions, including NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), which played a significant role in specifying the algorithm and its parameters. NIST published the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), which includes ECDSA as a variant, in its Special Publication 800-186
								</p>
									
								<p>
									While SECG has contributed to the standardization of elliptic curve cryptography, its primary focus has been on establishing standards for efficient and secure implementation of cryptographic algorithms. SECG has developed guidelines and recommendations for the use of elliptic curve cryptography, including key exchange protocols and digital signature schemes. However, the creation and initial development of ECDSA were not directly associated with the SECG.

								</p>
						
						<h4 class="mt-5">4. Final Hashing in Blockchain</h4>
							<p>
								In addition to the initial hashing process, blockchain technology often employs iterative hashing techniques to enhance security further. Iterative hashing involves repeatedly applying a hash function to the output of a previous hashing operation.
							</p>

							<p>
								In Bitcoin, the final hash used is a combination of the SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hash functions. SHA-256 is used to hash the entire transaction, and then the resulting hash is further processed using RIPEMD-160 to generate a shorter hash known as the "transaction ID" or "hash160." This transaction ID is used for various purposes, including uniquely identifying transactions and addresses.
							</p>

							<p>
								In Ethereum, the process of generating an address for a smart contract involves taking the rightmost 160 bits of the Keccak-256 hash of the contract's address creator's address and public key. These 160 bits are then passed through the RIPEMD-160 hash function, resulting in a final 20-byte address that is used to identify the smart contract on the Ethereum network.

								<h5>1. sha256(const std::string&amp; data):</h5>
								<p>
									This function takes a string <code>data</code> as input and calculates the SHA-256 hash of that data using the OpenSSL library. It initializes the SHA-256 context, updates it with the data, and then finalizes it to obtain the resulting hash. The hash is stored in an unsigned character array <code>hash</code>, which is then converted to a string <code>hashStr</code> using a reinterpret cast. Finally, the function returns the SHA-256 hash as a string.
								</p>
								

								<h5>2. ripemd160(const std::string&amp; data):</h5>
								<p>
									This function takes a string <code>data</code> as input and calculates the RIPEMD-160 hash of that data using the OpenSSL library. It initializes the RIPEMD-160 context, updates it with the data, and finalizes it to obtain the resulting hash. The hash is stored in an unsigned character array <code>hash</code>, which is then converted to a string <code>hashStr</code> using a reinterpret cast. Finally, the function returns the RIPEMD-160 hash as a string.
								</p>

								<h5>3. combineHashes(const std::string&amp; data):</h5>
								<p>
									This function combines the SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hashes to generate the final transaction ID. It calls the <code>sha256</code> function to calculate the SHA-256 hash of the input <code>data</code>, and then passes this SHA-256 hash to the <code>ripemd160</code> function to calculate the RIPEMD-160 hash. The resulting RIPEMD-160 hash is returned as the transaction ID.
								</p>

								<p>
									In the <code>main</code> function, an example transaction data string is provided as <code>transactionData</code>. The <code>combineHashes</code> function is called with this transaction data, and the resulting transaction ID is stored in the <code>transactionID</code> variable. Finally, the transaction ID is printed to the console using <code>std::cout</code>.
								</p>
								<p>
									When running this code, it will output the transaction ID generated by combining the SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hashes for the provided transaction data.
								</p>

								<p>
									This iterative process serves to increase the complexity and strength of the cryptographic protections in blockchain systems. By subjecting the data to multiple rounds of hashing, the probability of successful attacks or collisions is significantly reduced.
								</p>

								<p>
									Iterative hashing in blockchain adds an extra layer of security, making it even more challenging for malicious actors to tamper with or alter data stored on the blockchain. This technique reinforces the integrity and immutability of the blockchain, providing a robust foundation for trust and reliability.

						<h4>5. Encoding Techniques in Blockchain</h4>

								<p>
									In the context of blockchain, encoding techniques are utilized to represent and transmit data efficiently and securely. Encoding transforms data into a standardized format, enabling its storage, transmission, and decoding by various blockchain participants.
								</p>

								<p>
									Common encoding techniques used in blockchain include Base58 and Base64, which convert binary data into a human-readable format. These encoding methods are frequently used for blockchain addresses, transaction data, and other relevant information.
								</p>

								<p>
									By employing encoding techniques, blockchain technology ensures interoperability and efficient data handling across different platforms and systems. The use of standardized encoding enables seamless integration and consistent interpretation of data within the blockchain ecosystem.

								<p></p>
								
								<p>
									SECP256K1 is an elliptic curve cryptographic curve that is used in a variety of applications, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is a 256-bit curve, which means that it uses a 256-bit number to generate public and private keys. Quantum computers can attack SECP256K1 by using Shor's algorithm. Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can factor large numbers into their prime factors. This is a critical step in breaking the security of SECP256K1.
								<p>

								<p>
									logic behind Shor's algorithm is as follows:

								<h5>Shor's perform snippet code explaination:</h5>
							  
								<p>
									Shor's presented two polynomial time quantum algorithms, one for factoring integers, the other for computing discrete logarithms in finite fields. The second one can naturally be applied for computing discrete logarithms in the group of points on an elliptic curve defined over a finite field.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									We are given an instance of the ECDLP as described above. Let <code>P ∈ E(F<sub>p</sub>)</code> be a fixed generator of a cyclic subgroup of <code>E(F<sub>p</sub>)</code> of known order <code>ord(P) = r</code>, let <code>Q ∈ hP<sub>i</sub></code> be a fixed element in the subgroup generated by <code>P;</code> our goal is to find the unique integer <code>m ∈ {1, . . . , r}</code> such that <code>Q = [m]P</code>.
								</p>
							  
								<br>
								<h5>Shor’s algorithm proceeds as follows:</h5>
								
								<p>
									1. Two registers of length <code>n + 1</code> qubits are created and each qubit is initialized in the <code>|0⟩</code> state.
								</p>

								<p>
									2. Then a Hadamard transform <code>H</code> is applied to each qubit, resulting in the state <code>1/2<sup>(n+1)</sup> Σ<sup>2<sup>(n+1)</sup>-1</sup>_(k,`=0) |k, `i</code>.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									3. Next, conditioned on the content of the register holding the label <code>k</code> or <code>`</code>, we add the corresponding multiple of <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>, respectively, i.e., we implement the map:<br>
									<code>1/2<sup>(n+1)</sup> Σ<sup>2<sup>(n+1)</sup>-1</sup>_(k,`=0) |k, `i → 1/2<sup>(n+1)</sup> Σ<sup>2<sup>(n+1)</sup>-1</sup>_(k,`=0) |k, `i |[k]P + [`]Q<sub>i</sub></code>.
								</p>
								
								
								<p>
									4. Hereafter, the third register is discarded and a quantum Fourier transform <code>QFT<sub>2n+1</sub> on n + 1</code> qubits is computed on each of the two registers.
								</p>

								<p>
									5. Finally, the state of the first two registers—which hold a total of <code>2(n + 1)</code> qubits—is measured. As shown in, the discrete logarithm <code>m</code> can be computed from this measurement data via classical post-processing.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									Using Kitaev’s phase estimation framework, Beauregard obtained a quantum algorithm for factoring an integer <code>N</code> from a circuit that performs a conditional multiplication of the form <code>x → ax mod N</code>, where <code>a ∈ Z<sub>N</sub></code> is a random constant integer modulo <code>N</code>. The circuit uses only <code>2n+3</code> qubits, where <code>n</code> is the bit length of the integer to be factored. An implementation of this algorithm on <code>2n+2</code> qubits, using Toffoli-gate-based modular multiplication is described.
								</p>

						<p>
							Here are some potential threats if ECDSA is compromised:
						</p>
						
						<h5>1. Steal Assets:</h5> 
						<p>
							ECDSA is used to generate and verify digital signatures, which ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. If a bad actor can break ECDSA and recover the private key of a user, they can forge digital signatures and impersonate the user, potentially leading to unauthorized access, financial fraud, or data manipulation. This could result in stolen assets or compromised systems.
						</p>

						<h5>2. Privacy Breach:</h5>
						<p>
							ECDSA is often used for secure communication, such as establishing secure channels or encrypting sensitive data. If an attacker can break ECDSA, they may be able to intercept and decrypt confidential communications, compromising the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information.
						</p>

						<h5>3. Blockchain Vulnerabilities:</h5>
						<p>
							Many blockchain systems, including popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, rely on ECDSA for generating digital signatures and ensuring the security of transactions. If ECDSA is broken, it can lead to the theft of cryptocurrency funds, manipulation of transaction records, or even a collapse of the blockchain system's security.
						</p>

						<h5>4. Trust and Confidence Impact:</h5>
						<p>
							If ECDSA is compromised, it can undermine the trust and confidence in digital signatures and cryptographic systems based on ECDSA. This can have a widespread impact on the adoption of digital technologies and the reliability of digital transactions.

								<h5 class="mt-5">QFT perform snippet code explaination:</h5>
							</p>
							<p>
								If bad actors are able to successfully use Shor's algorithm or a similar quantum algorithm QFT to break the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), it can have serious security implications. ECDSA is widely used for digital signatures and encryption in various applications, including secure communication, financial transactions, and identity verification.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								ECDSA is not broken by factoring into primes, rather both problems are solved by variations of the quantum Fourier transform. Although slightly different, these variations are both known as Shor's algorithm.
							</p>
						
							<p>
								In ECDSA, there is an elliptic curve point that is known to everyone, denoted as <code>G</code>. A public key is a different point <code>P</code>, where <code>P = sG</code> and <code>s</code> is a secret value known only to the signer. The goal is to find <code>s</code> given only <code>G</code> and <code>P</code>.
								</p>
								
							<p>
								To solve this problem, Shor's algorithm maps the problem of finding <code>s</code> to a problem in period finding. It does this by defining a function <code>F</code> that takes elements from a set <code>T</code> and returns elements from the elliptic curve set <code>E</code>.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The function <code>F</code> takes a pair <code>(a, b)</code> where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are members of a set <code>Z</code> and maps it to the point <code>aG - bP</code>. Mathematically, this can be represented as <code>F(x) = F((a, b)) = aG - bP</code>.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The discrete logarithm problem in ECDSA is then transformed into a period-finding problem. The goal is to find the period <code>d</code> of the function <code>F</code>. However, <code>d</code> is not the only period of <code>F</code>; there are also multiples of <code>d</code> that satisfy <code>F(x + ad) = F(x)</code>.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Shor's algorithm, utilizing the principles of quantum superposition, can work through the complex intermediate state of the function <code>F</code> and identify the period <code>d</code> as the "signal" part of the function.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Once the period <code>d</code> is determined, it can be used to recover the private key <code>s</code>. By performing modulo ℓ division on the pair returned by the quantum computer, dividing <code>u</code> by <code>v mod ℓ</code>, the value of <code>s</code> can be obtained.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								By finding the private key <code>s</code>, an attacker can forge signatures and break ECDSA.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								We are given an instance of the ECDLP as described above. Let <code>P ∈ E(F<sub>p</sub>)</code> be a fixed generator of a cyclic subgroup of <code>E(F<sub>p</sub>)</code> of known order <code>ord(P) = r</code>, let <code>Q ∈ hP<sub>i</sub></code> be a fixed element in the subgroup generated by <code>P</code>; our goal is to find the unique integer <code>m ∈ {1, . . . , r}</code> such that <code>Q = [m]P</code>.
							</p>
							
							<br>
							<h5>QFTs algorithm proceeds as follows:</h5>
							<p>
								1. Two registers of length <code>n + 1</code> qubits are created, and each qubit is initialized in the <code>|0⟩</code> state.
							</p>

							<p>
								2. Then a Hadamard transform <code>H</code> is applied to each qubit, resulting in the state <code>1/2<sup>(n+1)</sup> Σ<sub>k=0</sub><sup>2<sup>(n+1)</sup>-1</sup> |k, i</code>.
							</p>

							<p>
								3. Next, conditioned on the content of the register holding the label <code>k</code> or <code>i</code>, we add the corresponding multiple of <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>, respectively. In other words, we implement the map:
								<br>
								<code>1/2<sup>(n+1)</sup> Σ<sub>k=0</sub><sup>2<sup>(n+1)</sup>-1</sup> |k, i</code> → <code>1/2<sup>(n+1)</sup> Σ<sub>k=0</sub><sup>2<sup>(n+1)</sup>-1</sup> |k, i |[k]P + [i]Q</code>.
							</p>

							<p>
								4. Hereafter, the third register is discarded, and a quantum Fourier transform <code>QFT<sub>2n+1</sub></code> on <code>n + 1</code> qubits is computed on each of the two registers.
							</p>

							<p>
								5. Finally, the state of the first two registers—which hold a total of <code>2(n + 1)</code> qubits—is measured. As shown in the figure, the discrete logarithm <code>m</code> can be computed from this measurement data via classical post-processing.
							</p>
								
							<p>
							Using Kitaev's phase estimation framework, Beauregard obtained a quantum algorithm for factoring an integer <code>N</code> from a circuit that performs a conditional multiplication of the form <code>x → ax mod N</code>, where <code>a ∈ ℤ<sub>N</sub></code> is a random constant integer modulo <code>N</code>. The circuit uses only <code>2n + 3</code> qubits, where <code>n</code> is the bit length of the integer to be factored. An implementation of this algorithm on <code>2n + 2</code> qubits, using Toffoli-gate-based modular multiplication is described.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Following the semiclassical Fourier transform method, one can modify Shor's ECDLP algorithm, resulting in the circuit shown in Figure 2. The phase shift matrices <code>R<sub>i</sub> = 100eiθ<sub>k</sub></code>, where <code>θ<sub>k</sub> = −πP<sub>k-1</sub>∑<sub>j=0</sub><sup>k</sup> 2<sup>k-j</sup>µ<sub>j</sub></code>, depend on all previous measurement outcomes <code>µ<sub>j</sub> ∈ {0, 1}</code>, <code>j ∈ {0, …, k−1}</code>.

								<h5>In the table we learn what the different between hash function in general</h5>
								
									<p>
										SHA2-256 and RIPMED-160 is widely adopted by blockchain technology in general, its strong combination has been proven by bitcoin over nearly 14 years the algorithm is very secure for any classical attack.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Today the best theoretical we known how to attack on this two combination at once is using Grover's algorithm.
										To attack two hash functions (SHA2-256 and RIPEMD-160) at once to finding private key, we can use a technique called parallel Grover's search. In parallel Grover's search, we create a quantum oracle that maps the hashes of the private key to the private key itself. This can be done by using a quantum computer to simulate the two hash functions.
									</p>
								
								<br>
								<h5>For paralel grover's search following this process:</h5>
									<p>
										1. <code>𝐾=2𝑘</code> copies of the search oracle <code>𝑈𝑆</code> that you can use. Normally, you'd search by iterating the action <code>𝐻⊗𝑛(𝕀𝑛−2|0⟩⟨0|⊗𝑛)𝐻⊗𝑛𝑈𝑆</code>, starting from an initial state <code>(𝐻|0⟩)⊗𝑛</code>. This takes time <code>Θ(𝑁‾‾√)</code>. (I'm using <code>𝕀𝑛</code> to denote the <code>2𝑛×2𝑛</code> identity matrix.)
									</p>

									<p>
										2. Replace this with <code>2𝑘</code> parallel copies, each indexed by an <code>𝑥∈{0,1}𝑘</code>, using <code>(𝕀𝑘⊗𝐻⊗(𝑛−𝑘))𝕀𝑘⊗(𝕀𝑛−𝑘−2|0⟩⟨0|⊗(𝑛−𝑘))(𝕀𝑘⊗𝐻⊗(𝑛−𝑘))𝑈𝑆</code> and starting from a state <code>|𝑥⟩(𝐻|0⟩)⊗(𝑛−𝑘)</code>. The time required for running these would be reduced to <code>𝑂(𝑁/𝐾‾‾‾‾‾√)</code>, at the cost of requiring <code>𝐾</code> times more space.
									</p>

									<p>
										3. In a scaling sense, one might consider this an irrelevant result. If you have a fixed number of oracles, <code>𝐾</code>, then you get a fixed <code>(𝐾‾‾√)</code> improvement (just like if you have <code>𝐾</code> parallel classical cores, the best improvement you can get is a factor of <code>𝐾</code>), and that does not change the scaling. But it does change the fundamental running time. We know that Grover's algorithm is exactly optimal. It takes the absolute minimum time possible with a single oracle. So, knowing that you get a <code>𝐾‾‾√</code> improvement in time is useful with regards to that benchmark of a specific running time at a specific value of <code>𝑁</code>.
									</p>

									<p>
										4. In a sense, if we were doing it in parallel on different nodes, you would save time for running. But if we talk about complexity (that is what we refer to speedup generally), we need a bit of analysis.
									</p>

									<p>
										5. You agree that we need about <code>𝑁‾‾√</code> operations for the non-parallel case. Say we have two nodes, and we separate the list of <code>N</code> elements into two lists of size <code>𝑁1,𝑁2</code>. The search on the sub-lists takes about <code>𝑁1‾‾‾√,𝑁2‾‾‾√</code>.
									</p>

									<p>
										6. However, we have that <code>𝑁‾‾√=𝑁1+𝑁2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√≤𝑁1‾‾‾√+𝑁2‾‾‾√</code>. And you would still need to verify which output among what is returned by the parallel processes is the one you seek. It adds a constant in the complexity, so we generally hide it into the <code>𝑂</code> notation.
									</p>

									<p>
										7. However, that would still be interesting, especially if we have to cluster hardware because we are limited in the number of qubits or another limitations.
									</p>

									<p>
										8. Once we have created the quantum oracle, we can use parallel Grover's search to find the private key. Parallel Grover's search works by repeatedly querying the quantum oracle with random inputs. Each time the quantum oracle is queried, it will return the private key with a 50% probability. After a certain number of queries, the probability of finding the private key will be very close to 1.
									</p>

									<p>
										9. The time it takes to find the private key using parallel Grover's search is <code>O(√N/2)</code>, where <code>N</code> is the number of possible inputs to the two hash functions. This is a quadratic speedup over the best known classical algorithm, which takes <code>O(N)</code> time.

								<h5>Paralel Grover's search snippet code explaination:</h5>

									<p>
										1. The <code>grover_parallel</code> function takes two arguments, <code>n</code> and <code>k</code>, representing the number of qubits and the number of copies of the search oracle, respectively. It returns a quantum circuit that implements the parallel version of Grover's algorithm.

										3. The qubits are initialized to a uniform superposition by applying a Hadamard gate <code>(h)</code> to each qubit.
									</p>

									<p>
										4. The search oracle is applied <code>k</code> times by appending the <code>grover_oracle</code> circuit to the main circuit. The <code>grover_oracle</code> function creates a circuit that implements the search oracle for Grover's algorithm.

									</p>

									<p>
										10. A phase flip <code>(Z gate)</code> is applied to the first qubit if all other qubits are in the <code>|0⟩</code> state. This step amplifies the amplitude of the desired solution state.
									</p>

									<p>
										11. Finally, the circuit is returned.
									</p>

									<p>
										12. The <code>hash_oracle</code> function is similar to the <code>grover_oracle</code> function but implements a hash function oracle instead. It takes one argument, <code>n</code>, representing the number of qubits, and returns a quantum circuit that implements the hash oracle.
									</p>

								<br>
								<h5>1. The end of classical era</h5>
								<p>
									For decades <span><a class="docs-theme-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/moores-law" target="_blank">Moore's Law</a></span> has guided the exponential growth of classical computing power. It states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, leading to remarkable advancements. However, we are approaching the maximum capacity of classical computing using this law.
								</p>
								<p>
									As transistors become smaller, we face significant challenges in miniaturization. The physical limitations of classical computers will hinder further progress. This limitation signals the end of the classical algorithm and computers, prompting us to seek new approaches.
								</p>

								<h5>2. The Advantages of Quantum Computers</h5>
								<p>
									Quantum computing takes advantage of the laws of quantum mechanics found in nature and represents a fundamental change from classical information processing. Two properties of quantum behavior – superposition and entanglement – may allow quantum computers to solve problems intractable for today’s conventional, or classical, machines:
								</p>

								<p>
									— Superposition. A classical computer uses binary bits that can only depict either a “1” or a “0.” Instead, quantum computers use qubits that can depict a “1”, a “0”, or any combination (or “superposition”) of the qubits’ possible states. Therefore, a quantum computer with n qubits can have all 2n possibilities in superposition with one another. This supplies quantum computers with an exponential set of states they can explore to solve certain types of problems better than classical computers.
								</p>

								<p>
									— Entanglement. In the quantum world, two qubits located even light-years apart can still act in ways that are strongly correlated. Quantum computing takes advantage of this entanglement to encode problems that exploit interdependence between qubits.
								</p>

								<p>
									The quantum properties of superposition and entanglement help enable quantum computers to rapidly explore an enormous set of possibilities to identify an optimal answer that could drive business value. As future quantum computers can calculate certain answers exponentially faster than today’s classical machines, they will enable tackling business problems that are exponentially more complex. Despite classical computers’ limitations, quantum computers are not expected to replace them in the foreseeable future. Instead, hybrid quantum-classical architectures are expected to emerge that “outsource” portions of difficult problems to a quantum computer.
								</p>

								<p>
									Quantum computing appears set to potentially transform certain industries. For instance, current computational chemistry methods rely heavily on approximation because the exact equations cannot be solved by classical computers. But, quantum algorithms are expected to deliver accurate simulations of molecules over longer timescales, currently impossible to model precisely. This could enable life-saving drug discoveries and significantly shorten the number of years required to develop pharmaceuticals.
								</p>



								<h5>3. The Obsolescence of Classical Algorithms</h5>
								<p>
									As we enter the quantum era, classical algorithms will become obsolete and irrelevant. Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm, possess the power to break the cryptographic foundations on which blockchain technology relies.
								</p>

								<p>
									This poses a significant threat to the security and integrity of existing blockchain systems. The immutability and trust that blockchain provides can be compromised by quantum attacks. It is crucial for blockchain foundations to adapt and transition towards quantum-resistant algorithms.
								</p>

								<p>
									By embracing quantum-resistant algorithms, blockchain platforms can ensure the long-term viability and security of their systems. Proactive measures are necessary to protect user data, maintain the integrity of transactions, and preserve trust within the blockchain community.
								</p>

							<p>
								As the quantum era unfolds, it is vital for blockchain foundations to understand the implications and adapt accordingly. By acknowledging the limitations of Moore's Law, recognizing the advantages of quantum computers, and preparing for the obsolescence of classical algorithms, blockchain technology can thrive in this new era.
							</p>
							<p>
								Embracing quantum computing will foster innovation, enhance security, and open doors to groundbreaking possibilities. Let us take this transformative journey together, ensuring that the blockchain community remains at the forefront of technological advancements.

							After six years of research and development, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has announced the first four quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. The chosen algorithms, CRYSTALS-KYBER, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+, are designed to withstand attacks from future quantum computers, which are expected to be significantly more powerful than the current generation of machines.

						<p>
							The development of quantum-resistant encryption is a critical step in ensuring the security of our digital infrastructure. As quantum computers become more powerful, they pose a serious threat to the security of our current encryption systems. The chosen algorithms will help to ensure that our data remains secure even in the face of this threat.

							In 1996, Miklós Ajtai made a significant contribution to  <span><a class="docs-theme-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography" target="_blank">Lattice-based cryptography</a></span> by introducing a cryptographic construction that relied on the hardness of lattice problems. Collaborating with Cynthia Dwork, they demonstrated the difficulty of solving the Short Integer Solutions (SIS) problem, an average-case lattice problem, which proved to be as challenging as worst-case lattice problems.
						</p>

						<p>
							Two years later, Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, and Joseph H. Silverman introduced a lattice-based public-key encryption scheme called NTRU. Although their scheme did not demonstrate the same level of hardness as solving a worst-case lattice problem, it marked an important milestone in lattice-based cryptography.
						</p>
							
						<p>
							In 2005, Oded Regev presented the first lattice-based public-key encryption scheme with a security proof based on worst-case hardness assumptions. Regev's work also introduced the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem. Since then, researchers have dedicated significant efforts to improving the security proofs and efficiency of Regev's original scheme.
						</p>
							
						<p>
							The field of lattice-based cryptography has witnessed extensive development, with additional cryptographic primitives being constructed based on LWE and related problems. Notably, Craig Gentry introduced the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme in 2009, which was also based on a lattice problem.
						</p>
							
						<p>
							The history of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography spans several decades, with numerous algorithms developed since 1996. The NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Competition has been a significant milestone in this journey, aiming to standardize post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. The European Commission has also played a vital role in funding the PQCRYPTO project, which focuses on the development of post-quantum cryptography since 2015.

							CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm is based on lattice-based cryptography. It utilizes the hardness of certain mathematical problems associated with lattices to provide secure key exchange. The specific mathematical problem it relies on is called the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem over modular lattices.
						  </p>

						  <p>
							In the CRYSTALS-Kyber scheme, the security of the key exchange is based on the assumption that solving the LWE problem is computationally difficult. The scheme involves generating public and private keys, and during the key exchange, the parties use these keys to establish a shared secret key securely. The security of the scheme lies in the difficulty of an attacker solving the LWE problem and obtaining the shared secret key without knowing the private key

							<h5>1. Lattices</h5>
								<p>
									A lattice in <code>ℝ<sup>n</sup></code>, denoted by <code>L</code>, is generated by a set of linearly independent vectors <code>𝐵 = {𝐛<sub>1</sub>, 𝐛<sub>2</sub>, ..., 𝐛<sub>m</sub>}</code>. It is the set of all integer linear combinations <code>𝐵𝑥 = ∑𝐛<sub>𝑖</sub>𝑥<sub>𝑖</sub></code>, where <code>𝑥 ∈ ℤ<sup>m</sup></code>. The vectors <code>𝐛<sub>1</sub>, 𝐛<sub>2</sub>, ..., 𝐛<sub>m</sub></code> form a basis for <code>L</code>.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									The lattice <code>L</code> can be generated using a matrix <code>B</code>, where the basis vectors are represented as column vectors.
								</p>

							<br>
							<h5>2. Computational Lattice Problems</h5>
								<p>
									The unique structure of lattices allows for efficient evaluation of certain computations using linear algebra algorithms. The following problems can be solved efficiently:
								</p>

								<p>
									a.) Basis Computation: Given a set of vectors <code>𝑔<sub>1</sub>, 𝑔<sub>2</sub>, ..., 𝑔<sub>𝑘</sub></code> that generate the lattice <code>L</code>, compute a basis <code>𝑏<sub>1</sub>, 𝑏<sub>2</sub>, ..., 𝑏<sub>𝑚</sub></code> for <code>L</code>.
								</p>

								<p>
									b.) Membership Testing: Determine whether a given vector <code>c</code> belongs to the lattice <code>L</code>.
								</p>

								<br>
								<p>
									Computational lattice problems are generally challenging and are believed to resist attacks such as Shor's algorithm. These problems are of interest for post-quantum cryptography. Here are two such problems:
								</p>

								<p>
									a.) Shortest Vector Problem (SVP): Given a lattice <code>L</code> with basis <code>B ∈ ℝ<sup>n×m</sup></code> and a norm <code>∥·∥</code>, find a nonzero vector <code>l ∈ L</code> such that <code>∥l∥</code> is the shortest length among all nonzero lattice vectors.
								</p>

								<p>
									b.) Closest Vector Problem (CVP): Given a lattice <code>L</code> with basis <code>B ∈ ℝ<sup>n×m</sup></code> and a norm <code>∥·∥</code>, find a lattice vector <code>l ∈ L</code> that minimizes the distance <code>∥l - q∥</code> to a given vector <code>q ∈ ℝ<sup>n</sup></code>.
								</p>

								<p>
									An illustration of the shortest vector problem, showcasing a shortest vector within a lattice. Demonstrates the closest vector problem, depicting a random point and its corresponding closest lattice vector.
								</p>

								<p>
									These computational problems highlight the intricate nature of lattices and their significance in cryptographic applications.
								</p>

							<br>
							<h5>3. LWE Fundamentals:</h5>
								  <p>
									Let <code>ℤq = ℤ/qℤ</code> be the ring of integers modulo <code>q</code>. We can create <code>a</code> linear equation system <code>A · s = b</code>, where <code>A ∈ ℤq<sup>m×n</sup></code>, <code>s ∈ ℤq<sup>n</sup></code>, and <code>b ∈ ℤq<sup>m</sup></code>. For example, consider the following system:
								  </p>

								  <pre>
		A = [10 3 5 1; 4 1 1 2; ...; 3 1 1 5]
		b = [10 3 ... 8]
									</pre>

								  <p>
									Then, the associated equations look like:
								  </p>

								  <pre>
		10 · s₁ + 3 · s₂ + 5 · s₃ + 1 · s₄ = 10
		4 · s₁ + 1 · s₂ + 1 · s₃ + 2 · s₄ = 3
		...
		3 · s₁ + 1 · s₂ + 1 · s₃ + 5 · s₄ = 8
									</pre>

								  <p>
									Solving this equation system can be efficiently done using the Gaussian algorithm. However, adding even small error values <code>e ∈ ℤq<sup>m</sup></code> to the equation system yields:
								  </p>

								  <pre>
		A · s + e = b
								</pre>
								  <p>
									which makes solving the equation system and retrieving the solution vector s surprisingly hard. This hardness is related to the difficult lattice problems described above.
								  </p>

							<br>
							<h5>4. Decisional LWE</h5>
								<p>
									The LWE problem can also be posed as a decision problem, abbreviated as dLWE. Given an LWE sample (<code>A, b</code>) as defined above (with <code>s</code> and <code>e</code> kept secret), the task is to guess whether the values of <code>b</code> have been calculated as <code>A · s + e</code> with small error values <code>e</code> or whether they have been chosen arbitrarily. Both variants are equally hard. The reduction from LWE to dLWE has been proven by Regev (Regev, Lemma 4.2), and the inverse reduction from dLWE to LWE is trivial.
								</p>
							
							<br>
							<h5>5. Linking LWE to Computational Lattice Problems</h5>
								<p>
									Consider an LWE problem of the form <code>A · s + e = b</code>, where <code>A ∈ ℤq<sup>m×n</sup></code>, <code>s ∈ ℤq<sup>n</sup></code>, and small vectors <code>e ∈ ℤq<sup>m</sup></code>, <code>b ∈ ℤq<sup>m</sup></code>. We can solve <code>a</code> concrete LWE instance by solving the closest vector problem. The closest vector to <code>b</code> is often the lattice vector <code>A · s</code> with distance <code>e</code>.
								</p>

								<p>
									To understand the relationship between learning with errors and the shortest vector problem, consider the lattice <code>L = {v ∈ ℤ<sup>n+1</sup> | (v|v′) · A = 0 mod q}</code>, where the operator <code>'||'</code> denotes concatenation and <code>A</code> is the <code>n×n</code> identity matrix. It can be observed that the column vector (<code>s, e, 1</code>) is an element of <code>L</code> by verifying that <code>(A|(-A)) · (s, e, 1) = A · s + e = b = 0 holds</code>. It can be shown that the vector (<code>s, e, 1</code>) is a shortest vector in <code>L</code> and, therefore, a solution for the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) for <code>L</code>. This means retrieving the vector (<code>s, e, 1</code>) directly yields the secret <code>s</code> and the error vector <code>e</code>, effectively solving the LWE system.
								</p>
							
							<br>
							<h5>6. LWE-Based Encryption Schemes</h5>
							
								<p>
									This section provides a high-level introduction to LWE-based encryption schemes to facilitate an easy understanding of their basic idea. The following simplified example is used to transmit a message consisting of a single bit, but it can be extended to transmit a bitstring of any length.
								</p>

								<p>
									Consider an LWE instance <code>A · s + e = b</code>, where <code>A ∈ ℤq<sup>m×n</sup></code> is chosen. The goal of LWE-based encryption schemes is to leverage the hardness of the LWE problem to design secure encryption schemes. These schemes typically involve a public key and a private key, allowing for secure communication between parties.

						<h2 class="section-heading">PQC "Stateless" Hash-based digital signature</h2>
						<p>
							From Lamport to PQC SPHINCS+
						</p>
						<br>
						<h4>1. Lamport signature:</h4>
							<p>
								In 1979, Leslie Lamport introduced a groundbreaking method for one-time signatures. Lamport's approach involved the creation of two data sets comprising 256 random 256-bit numbers, referred to as Set A and Set B. Each of these sets formed the private key, consisting of a total of 512 values. By hashing each random number, a corresponding set of 512 hashes was derived, which constituted the public key. This article explores Lamport's method, highlights its limitations, and delves into the subsequent development of Merkle trees as a solution.
							</p>


							<h6>Lamport Method:</h6>
							<p>
								Lamport's method operates by hashing the message and then examining each bit of the resulting hash (ranging from 0 to 255). If a bit is 0, the corresponding element from Set A is used; otherwise, the corresponding element from Set B is employed. The signature itself comprises 256 random numbers selected from either Set A or Set B, while the public key consists of the 512 generated hashes. Notably, both the public and private keys measure 16KB in size, making Lamport signatures computationally demanding.
							</p>


							<h6>Limitations of Lamport Signatures:</h6>
							<p>
								Despite its innovative nature, the Lamport method suffers from a fundamental drawback. With this approach, a unique key pair is required for each individual message, which poses scalability and efficiency challenges. Recognizing this limitation, researchers sought alternatives that could overcome the need for a new key pair for every message.
							</p>


						<br>
						<h4>2. The Emergence of Merkle Trees:</h4>
							<p>
								In the same year as Lamport's groundbreaking work, a solution to the key pair issue arose through the concept of Merkle trees. Merkle trees, named after Ralph Merkle, are a hashing technique widely used in various applications, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Git distribution systems, No SQL databases, and P2P networks. By hashing and pairing data elements, Merkle trees construct a hierarchical structure, culminating in a root element known as the root hash. This root hash serves as proof of knowledge of all other hashes in the tree while keeping them concealed.
							</p>

							<h6>Utilizing Merkle Trees for Signatures:</h6>
							<p>
								The utilization of Merkle trees in the context of signatures presented a significant advancement. Instead of creating a new key pair for each message, Merkle trees allowed for the authentication of multiple messages with a single key pair. This was achieved through the concept of Many-Time Signatures (MTS) within a hypertree. By employing a hierarchical structure, MTS enabled the authentication of a large number of Few-Time Signatures (FTS) key pairs.
							</p>
					
						<br>
						<h4>3. One time signature:</h4>
						<p>
							In the pursuit of improving the performance and reducing key sizes of signature methods, Robert Winternitz proposed the Winternitz One-Time Signature (W-OTS). Named after its creator, W-OTS allows for the simultaneous signing of multiple bits, presenting a significant advancement in the field. This article explores the principles and methodology behind W-OTS, shedding light on its key features and demonstrating its functionality through a visual illustration.
						</p>
						
						<h6>Winternitz OTS Method:</h6>
						<p>
							The Winternitz OTS method begins by generating 32 random numbers, each consisting of 256 bits. These 32 values constitute the private key. Subsequently, each of these values undergoes 256 iterations of hashing, resulting in the generation of 32 corresponding values that form the public key.
						</p>
						<p>
							To create a signature using W-OTS, the message is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm. This process yields 32 8-bit values, denoted as <code>N1, N2, ..., N32</code>. Each of these 8-bit values is then utilized to determine the number of iterations for subsequent hashing operations. Specifically, the value N determines the number of times the 8-bit signature value will be hashed (<code>256 - N</code> times).
						</p>
						<p>
							To verify the signature, the original message is hashed using SHA-256 once again. The resulting hash is then processed by examining each 8-bit value. For each value, the 8-bit signature value is hashed a number of times equal to the corresponding message hash value <code>(N1, N2, ...)</code>. The outcome of each operation should equal the corresponding value in the public key.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h4>4. HORS:</h4>
						<p>
							Hash to Obtain Random Subset (HORS) is an advanced quantum-robust, hashed-based one-time signature scheme. By leveraging the power of hashing and indexing, HORS enables the creation of private and public key pairs to achieve secure and unique signatures. This article explores the methodology behind HORS, highlighting its key steps and demonstrating its application through a simple example.
						</p>

						<h6>HORS Methodology:</h6>
						<p>
							The HORS method begins by generating a series of integers to serve as private key values. These values, ranging from priv0 to priv255, are organized in an indexable form. Subsequently, each private key value undergoes a hashing process, resulting in a list of corresponding public key values, denoted as pub. These public key values are indexed for future reference.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h4>5. XMSS Hash-based signature schemes:</h4> 
						<p>
							Such as the Merkle Signature Scheme (MSS), have played a vital role in various applications. However, MSS suffers from performance and memory limitations. To overcome these challenges, enhanced methods like XMSS and SPHINCS have emerged. This article delves into the drawbacks of XMSS and introduces SPHINCS, a stateless variant that addresses the state-related issues while preserving the core methods of XMSS.
						</p>

						<h6>Merkle Signature Scheme (MSS):</h6>
						<p>
							The core principle behind MSS lies in Merkle trees, which enable efficient hashing and verification of data elements. However, MSS encounters significant performance and memory concerns, limiting its practicality in certain scenarios.
						</p>

						<h6>XMSS and its Stateful Nature:</h6>
						<p>
							To enhance the efficiency of MSS, the XMSS method was introduced. XMSS reduces the performance overhead associated with MSS but introduces a stateful nature to the signature scheme. This statefulness implies that private keys must be retained and not reused, posing challenges in managing and securing a growing number of private keys.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h5>"The problem with XMSS is because it is Statefull"</h5>

						<br>
						<br>
						<h2>SPHINCS+:</h2>
						<p>
							SPHINCS+ (Stateless" PHotonic Isogeny-based Signature Scheme), a hybrid signature scheme that combines hash-based, code-based, and isogeny-based components to achieve statelessness and post-quantum security.
						</p>
						<p>
							In a post-quantum world, where powerful quantum computers exist, the need to eliminate or reduce reliance on state in cryptographic systems arises due to the potential impact of quantum computing on traditional cryptographic algorithms.
						</p>

						<p>
							The idea behind "stateless digital signature" is to eliminate the state that is stored by the signer between signatures, why? because quantum-computers using superposition that means it can in the two probability in multiple states at once. This state can be used by an attacker to forge signatures, so eliminating it makes the signature scheme more secure.
						</p>

						<p>
							In a stateful digital signature scheme, the signer stores a secret key and a signing state between signatures. The signing state is used to generate the signatures, and it can be used by an attacker to forge signatures if they are able to obtain it.
						</p>

						<p>
							In a stateless digital signature scheme, the signer does not store any state between signatures. Instead, the signing state is generated on the fly when the signer wants to create a signature. This makes it much more difficult for an attacker to forge signatures, as they would need to obtain the secret key and the random seed that was used to generate the signing state.
						</p>

						<p>
							Stateless digital signature schemes are more efficient than stateful digital signature schemes, as they do not require the signer to store any state between signatures. They are also more secure, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.
						</p>
							
						<p>
							Stateful cryptographic systems typically involve the storage of sensitive information, such as secret keys or internal states, which are used to perform cryptographic operations. These systems can be more vulnerable to attacks in a post-quantum world because quantum computers could potentially exploit the stored information to compromise the security of the system.
						</p>
							
						<p>
							By eliminating or reducing state in cryptographic systems, the aim is to develop stateless algorithms that do not rely on the storage of sensitive information or the maintenance of long-term states. Stateless algorithms operate solely based on the input provided at the time of the cryptographic operation without relying on any stored information. This can potentially enhance the security of cryptographic systems against attacks that target the stored information.
						</p>
							
						<p>
							Statelessness can reduce the attack surface and mitigate certain types of attacks, such as side-channel attacks that aim to extract sensitive information from the system's state. By eliminating state, cryptographic systems become more resistant to attacks that target stored secrets or exploit vulnerabilities in state management.

							<h6>Figure 1</h6>
							  summarizes a SPHINCS+ hypertree. It is composed of FTS and OTS nodes representing FTS and OTS trees, respectively. The hypertree is composed of hash nodes, forming the root of a tree inside a layer. Each root is connected to an OTS node, storing a WOTS+ leaf. The objects in gray correspond to the authentication path of each select OTS node. The root of the SPHINCS+ hypertree, pk, is the signature scheme’s public key.
						</p>

						<p>
							The lowest layer is formed by FTS nodes that are FORS trees, responsible for signing a message. A message, represented by the envelope, is signed using a combination of leaves picked up from each of the FTS trees. These leaves are addressed by a string formed by a random value and the digest of the signed message. The random value is used to mitigate side-channel attacks if someone stores any information from several signatures.
						</p> 

						<br>
						<h6>Figure 2</h6> 
						<p>
							An illustrates a FORS tree. It is composed by k FTS trees with t leaves and height <code>b = log2(t)</code>.
						</p>

						<br>
						<h6>Figrure table 3</h6>
						<p>
							The parameter n is the size in bytes of the digest generated by the hash function used by the SPHINCS+ signature scheme; the parameter <code>h</code> corresponds to the hypertree height and defines the maximum number of signa- tures <code>(2h)</code> that can be performed; the parameter <code>d</code> is the number of layers of the hypertree; the parameter <code>w</code>, Winternitz parameter, is the number of bits to be signed simultaneously in a WOTS+ signature, providing a trade-off between signing time and signature size; the parameter <code>k</code> is the number of FTS trees in a FORS tree and, finally, the parameter <code>b</code> is the FORS tree height.
						</p>

						<p>
							The parameter len is the number of n-byte blocks that form a WOTS+ signature. 
						</p>
						<p>
							It is given by <code>len = len1 + len2,</code> where <code>len1 = ⌈ 8n log2(w)
							⌉ and len2 = ⌊log2(len1(w−1))⌋. log2(w)</code>
							The parameter <code>len1</code> is the number of integers, between <code>0</code> and <code>w - 1</code>, that represents the hash digest of the WOTS+ message to be signed. The parameter <code>len2</code> is the number of integers, between <code>0</code> and <code>w - 1</code>, used to represent the WOTS+ checksum, needed to avoid signatureforgery. SPHINCS+ parameters influenc eover it ssignature size, performance and security. The signature size has <code>(h + k · (b + 1) + d · len + 1)n</code> bytes
						</p>

						<br>
						<h6>Key Generation Process</h6>
						<p>
							The key generation process is influenced by <code>h</code>, <code>d</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>len</code> parameters. For <code>a</code> fixed value of <code>h</code>, the larger <code>d</code>, the faster is the key generation. A smaller value for the Winternitz parameter results in a faster key generation.
						</p>

						<br>
						<h6>Signing and Verification Processes</h6>
						<p>
							The signing and verification processes are linearly dependent on the parameters <code>k</code> and <code>t</code>. So a FORS tree with a larger number of FTS trees and higher height leads to a slower signing scheme.
						</p>

						<br>
						<h6>Security of SPHINCS+</h6>
						<p>
							The security of SPHINCS+ is measured statistically. Eq. Gives the probability <code>p</code> that a new message digest selects FORS leaves that are covered by positions already revealed in <code>qs</code> signatures. It represents the probability that a FORS leaf is hit &gamma; times after <code>qs</code> = 2<code>h</code> signatures in a SPHINCS+ signature scheme with hypertree height equal to <code>h</code>, <code>k</code> FORS trees, and <code>t</code> leaves in each FORS tree.
						</p>

						<pre>
		<em>p</em> = 1 - 1 - 1 - (1 - &gamma;)<sup><em>k</em> &sdot; <em>qs</em></sup> &sdot; (1 - (1 - &gamma;)<sup><em>qs</em> - &gamma;</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> &sdot; (1 - &gamma;<sup>-1</sup>)
						</pre>

						<p>The security level <em>s</em> in bits, against quantum computers, for a SPHINCS+ signature scheme is given by eq.</p>

						<pre>
		<em>s</em> = -log<sub>2</sub> (<em>&gamma;</em> &sdot; <em>k</em> &sdot; <em>qs</em>) - 1 - (1 - &gamma;)<sup><em>k</em> &sdot; <em>qs</em></sup> &sdot; (1 - (1 - &gamma;)<sup><em>qs</em> - &gamma;</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> &sdot; (1 - &gamma;<sup>-1</sup>) / (2 &sdot; 28<em>n</em>)
						</pre>

						<h6>Parameter Exploration</h6>
						<p>
							As the parameters <code>h</code>, <code>k</code>, and <code>b</code> are the ones that influence the security level, it is necessary to determine, by parameter-space exploration, the sets of parameters that produce the desired security level.
						</p>

						<br>
						<h6>Reducing Signature Size</h6>
						<p>
							We work on finding sets of parameters that produce smaller SPHINCS+ signatures, ideal for blockchain operation. The initial approach is made by reducing the maximum number of signatures, as we believe a blockchain user will not need the total number of <code>2<sup>64</sup></code> signatures initially designed to be performed by SPHINCS+. A signature scheme with the capacity of performing at around <code>2<sup>20</sup></code> to <code>2<sup>30</sup></code> signatures is more than enough for a user in a blockchain environment. The next section examines specific sets of parameters that decrease signature size while maintaining at least a 128-bit security level against quantum computers.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Among the quantum-resistant signing algorithms, SPHINCS+ distinguishes for being stateless and providing a security level of 128 bits against quantum computers. Nonetheless, compared to RSA and ECDSA, its signature size is an obstacle when used in an environment such as a blockchain, where the signature and public key sizes are fundamental. Hence, this work provides a study on adapting SPHINCS+ to blockchain usage.
						</p>

						<p>
							It showed that it is possible to halve the SPHINCS+ signature size, keeping a security level of 128 bits, at the expense of reducing the SPHINCS+ hypertree height, and the total number of possible signatures. Furthermore, this study revealed that by reducing the hypertree height of the original SPHINCS+, it is possible to obtain a digital signature scheme with a smaller signature size and shorter signature creation time, more suitable to blockchain usage.

							SWIFFT is a collection of provably secure hash functions. It is based on the concept of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). SWIFFT is not the first hash function based on FFT, but it sets itself apart by providing a mathematical proof of its security. It also uses the LLL basis reduction algorithm. It can be shown that finding collisions in SWIFFT is at least as difficult as finding short vectors in cyclic/ideal lattices in the worst case. By giving a security reduction to the worst-case scenario of a difficult mathematical problem, SWIFFT gives a much stronger security guarantee than most other cryptographic hash functions.
						</p>

						<p>
							SWIFFT is a family of homomorphic hash functions provided as part of a candidate submission to the NIST hash function competition in 2008 by Vadim Lyubashevsky, Daniele Micciancio, Chris Peikert, and Alon Rosen. Unfortunately NIST was reject in first round in SHA3 competition. The family of SWIFFTX has an interesting set of characteristics:
						<p>
						
						<p>
							1. Provably collision-resistant: it is provably computationally hard to find a binary-valued <code>x</code> given its image under <code>f</code> that is chosen randomly.
						</p>

						<p>
							2. Universal: for any <code>x_1,x_2</code> in the domain the probability that <code>f(x_1) = f(x_2)</code> over the choice of <code>f</code> in the family is the inverse of the size of the range.
						</p>

						<p>
							3. Regular: if <code>x</code> is distributed uniformly then <code>f(x)</code> is distributed uniformly for any <code>f</code> in the family.
						</p>

						<p>
							4. Randomness extractor: even if <code>x</code> is not distributed uniformly, <code>f(x)</code> is distributed uniformly over the choice of <code>f</code> in the family
						</p>

						<p>
							5. Homomorphic: each <code>f</code> in the family is homomorphic over the domain.
						</p>
								
						<p>
							6. Facilitates ZKPoKPs: the resulting hash value can be readily used in ZKPoKPs.
						</p>

						<p>
							7. Facilitates post-quantum digital signatures: its homomorphism property enables short post-quantum hash-based digital signature schemes, such as K2SN-MSS.
						</p>

						<p>
							8. Constant-time: any <code>f</code> in the family is free of data-dependent branching and therefore facilitates avoidance of timing side-channel attacks.
						</p>

						<p>
							SWIFFTX as one of the fastest secure hash functions available, which is collision-resistant and supports zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of a preimage (ZKPoKP) and post-quantum digital signatures

					<section class="docs-section" id="item-4-3">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Problem statement</h2>
						<p>
							Existing blockchain networks face a critical vulnerability to quantum attacks, which arise from the rapidly advancing field of quantum computing. Traditional cryptographic algorithms that underpin blockchain security, such as Large integer like ECC family, are susceptible to being cracked by quantum computers, compromising the immutability and confidentiality of transactions.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							Quantum computers have the potential to render current blockchain systems obsolete by breaking the cryptographic algorithms used to secure transactions and validate consensus. This threat extends to both public and private blockchains, as quantum computers can compromise public key infrastructure, digital signatures, and other cryptographic primitives.
						</p>
					
						<br>
						<h4>1. ECC can be broken with a well-known vulnerability:</h4>
						<p>
							Most existing blockchain technology is using Elliptic Curve for generated key pair, which is that relies on prime integers. These prime integers that protect our private and public keys.
						</p>
						<p>
							Given an instance of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), we have a fixed generator point <code>P</code> in an elliptic curve over a finite field <code>Fp</code>, and a fixed point <code>Q</code> in the subgroup generated by <code>P</code>. The goal is to find the unique integer <code>m</code> such that <code>Q = [m]P</code>.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							Shor's algorithm for breaking ECC involves the use of quantum computing.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							1. The algorithm starts by creating two registers of qubits, each with a length of <code>n + 1</code>, and initializing them in the <code>|0⟩</code> state.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							 2. A Hadamard transform <code>(H)</code> is applied to each qubit, resulting in a superposition state.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							3. Conditioned on the content of the registers, the algorithm performs operations involving the points <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>, mapping the superposition state to a new state that includes the corresponding multiples of <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							The third register is discarded, and a quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is applied to each of the two registers.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							Finally, the measurement of the first two registers, which hold <code>2(n + 1)</code> qubits in total, provides data that can be used for classical post-processing to compute the discrete logarithm <code>m</code>.
						</p>
						
						<br>
						<p>
							<code>
								<h5>"Important to note: While the threat of quantum computers to ECC, specifically the SECP256K1 is real one, it will takes millions of physical-qubits for quantum-computers to break ECDLP.</h5>
							</code>
						</p>
					
						<br>
						<br>
						<h4>2. ECDSA can be broken with a well-known vulnerability:</h4>
						<p>
							Most existing blockchain technology is using Elliptic Curve for digital signature, which is that relies on prime integers. These prime integers that protect our private and public keys.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							1. In ECDSA, there is a known elliptic curve point denoted as <code>G</code>, and a public key <code>P</code> that is calculated as <code>P = sG,</code> where <code>s</code> is a secret value known only to the signer.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							2. Shor's algorithm maps the problem of finding the secret value <code>s</code> to a problem in period finding. It does this by defining a function <code>F</code> that takes a pair (<code>a, b</code>) and maps it to the point <code>aG - bP</code>.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							3. The goal is to find the period <code>d</code> of the function <code>F</code>, which can be achieved using the principles of quantum superposition and quantum Fourier transform (QFT).
						</p>
					
						<p>
							4. Once the period <code>d</code> is determined, it can be used to recover the private key <code>s</code> by performing certain mathematical operations involving modular division. By finding the private key <code>s</code>, an attacker can forge signatures and break ECDSA.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							It is important to note that Shor's algorithm and the details of quantum computing involve complex mathematical concepts, including quantum superposition, QFT, and modular arithmetic. These concepts enable the quantum computer to efficiently solve the problem of finding the private key in ECDSA, which would be computationally infeasible for classical computers.
						</p>

							<code>
								<h5>"Important to note: While the threat of quantum computers to ECC, specifically the SECP256K1 is real one, it will takes millions of physical-qubits for quantum-computers to break ECDLP.</h5>
							</code>
						</p>

						<br>
						<br>
						<h4>3. Hash function can be broken with a well-known vulnerability:</h4>
						<p>
							Most existing blockchain technology is using hash function based on merkle-damgard construction, which is relies on black-box function. Quantum computers have an ability to break its black-box with well-known paralelism vulnerability.
						</p>
					
						<div>
							<p>
							  1. Parallel Grover's search involves using multiple copies of the search oracle <code>𝑈𝑆</code> to speed up the search process.
							</p>
						  
							<p>
							  2. By running <code>𝑘</code> parallel copies of the search oracle, each indexed by <code>𝑥</code>, and starting from a specific state <code>|𝑥⟩(𝐻|0⟩)⊗(𝑛−𝑘)</code>, the time required for the search can be reduced to <code>𝑂(𝑁/𝐾‾‾√)</code>, at the cost of requiring <code>𝐾</code> times more space.
							</p>
						  
							<p>
							  3. While this parallel approach may not change the scaling behavior (as it still achieves a <code>𝐾‾‾√</code> improvement), it does change the fundamental running time and provides a benchmark for a specific value of <code>𝑁</code>.
							</p>
						  
							<p>
							  4. In terms of complexity, parallel Grover's search offers a speedup compared to non-parallel search. However, there are additional factors to consider, such as the need to verify the correct output among the parallel processes.
							</p>
						  
							<p>
							  5. The complexity of parallel Grover's search can be hidden within the <code>𝑂</code> notation, and it becomes particularly interesting when dealing with hardware limitations, such as a limited number of qubits.
							</p>
						  
							<p>
							  6. To break a hash function, the quantum oracle is created, and then parallel Grover's search is applied to find the private key. By querying the oracle with random inputs, the private key can be found with a high probability after a certain number of queries.
							</p>
						  
							<p>
							  The time complexity of finding the private key using parallel Grover's search is <code>O(√N/2)</code>, where <code>N</code> is the number of possible inputs to the hash functions. This represents a quadratic speedup compared to the best known classical algorithm, which takes <code>O(N)</code> time.
							</p>

							<p>
								<code>Succpq-itsr H,q (A)</code> represents the success probability of any (quantum) adversary <code>A</code> against <code>pq-itsr</code>.
								It involves the evaluation of a mapping function and an oracle query.
								The adversary aims to find another input that produces the same output as the oracle without the input being one of the queries.
								It is a strengthened version of target subset resilience in the multi-target setting.

						<h5>The Problem with Current Blockchain Security:</h5>
							<p>
								Blockchain technology has revolutionized various industries, providing decentralized and transparent systems. Central to its security is the cryptographic algorithms that protect sensitive information, secure transactions, and maintain the immutability of the blockchain ledger. However, traditional cryptographic algorithms, such as ECC(DSA), SHA family based on Merkle-Damgård and Keccak construction, are at risk of being broken by powerful quantum computers in the future. It will impacted to everything that running or build in the top of its blockchain.
							</p>

							<p>
								Quantum computers have the ability to exploit the weaknesses in these algorithms, rendering the security of blockchain networks compromised. This threat extends not only to financial transactions but also to sensitive data stored on the blockchain, including personal information, supply chain details, and healthcare records. The urgency to address this issue becomes apparent as we witness the rapid advancements in quantum computing technology.
							</p>

							<br>
							<h5>The Solution: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):</h5>
							<p>
								Post-quantum cryptography offers a promising solution to the imminent threat posed by quantum computers. PQC involves the development and implementation of new cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers. These algorithms are designed to withstand the computational power of quantum computers, ensuring the continued security and privacy of blockchain networks.
							</p>

							<br>
							<h5>Implementing PQC in Blockchain:</h5>
							<p>
								The implementation of PQC in blockchain systems requires a collaborative effort between researchers, developers, and blockchain projects. The transition to post-quantum cryptography involves careful planning and consideration to ensure compatibility, efficiency, and security.
							</p>

							<p>
								One of the key challenges in adopting PQC is the need for consensus among blockchain stakeholders. The migration to new cryptographic algorithms requires coordination and agreement across the entire network to avoid fragmentation and potential security gaps. Additionally, blockchain projects must consider the performance implications of implementing PQC, as some post-quantum algorithms may introduce increased computational overhead.
							</p>

							<p>
								Collaborative research and development efforts are already underway, exploring various post-quantum cryptographic algorithms suitable for blockchain applications. These include lattice-based, code-based, multivariate, and hash-based algorithms, among others. The goal is to identify algorithms that provide a balance between security, efficiency, and scalability, ensuring a seamless transition to post-quantum cryptography.
